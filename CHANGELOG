2.1 -> 2.1.1 
	    This is a very minor release to fix an issue caused by only loading
	    the packages needed (but not required) by Semigroups.

2.0 -> 2.1  
	    This is a minor release including some bug fixes and performance
	    improvements. 

	    *************************New features*************************
	    
	    • The functions: 
	      
	      - AsTransformationSemigroup,
	      -	AsPartialPermSemigroup, 
	      - AsBipartitionSemigroup,
	      - AsBlockBijectionSemigroup 

	      which are shortcuts to Range(IsomorphismXSemigroup(S)).

	    • A method for IsTransitive for a transformation semigroup and,
	    optionally, a positive integer or list of positive integers. This
	    method is based on Gabow's algorithm for determining the strongly
	    connected components of a directed graph.
	    
	    • The functions MeetSemigroupCongruence and JoinSemigroupCongruences
	    for finding the meet and join of a pair of congruences of a
	    semigroup.

	    • There is a new method for IsSynchronizingSemigroup, suggested by
	    Peter Cameron, with better complexity than the previous method. 

	    *************************Resolved issues************************* 
	    
	    Issue numbers refer to the issues on the tracker at:

	    http://bitbucket.org/james-d-mitchell/semigroups/issues
	    
	    • There was a bug in ReadGeneratorsFile, which meant it sometimes
	    returned fail. The mode argument for IO_FilteredFile was not given.
	    
	    • There was a bug in the \in method for a congruence of a Rees
	    0-matrix semigroup, which sometimes returned the wrong answer for
	    the zero of the semigroup.
	    
	    • There was a bug in IteratorFromGeneratorsFile that caused it to
	    read only every other line in the given file, and to crash if there
	    were an odd number of lines. 

	    • There was no hash function for bipartitions.
	    
	    • The documentation for InverseSubsemigroupByProperty did not
	    specify the arguments of the function. 

	    • Issue 82: it is now possible to take the quotient of a semigroup
	    by an ideal using the / operator. 

	    • Issue 96: IsIsomorphicSemigroup sometimes returned a false
	    negative by incorrectly comparing the output of
	    PartialOrderOfDClasses (up to isomorphism) rather than the
	    transitive reflexive closure of PartialOrderOfDClasses.
	    
	    • Issue 97: there was a bug in the Normalizer method, which
	    caused GAP to crash when the argument was a monoid with 0
	    generators. 
	    
	    • Issue 98: PartitionMonoid(1) returned the wrong answer, it was
	    missing the non-identity element. 
	    
	    • Issue 99: the documentation for PartialOrderOfDClasses was
	    incorrect. 
	    
	    • Issue 103: under certain circumstances an error was given when
	    trying to compute with an ideal of an inverse semigroup. 

1.4 -> 2.0
						
	    This is a major release including many new features and several bug
	    fixes. 

	    *************************New features*************************

	    • extensive new features for computing with elements and
	    subsemigroups of the partition monoid. It is now possible to compute
	    with semigroups, monoids, inverse semigroups, inverse monoids, and
	    ideals consisting of elements of the partition monoid. Examples of
	    subsemigroups of this type are the Brauer monoids, Temperley-Lieb
	    monoids, and the dual symmetric inverse monoid. See Chapter 5 of the
	    manual for more details;

	    • support for ideals of transformation, partial permutation, and
	    bipartition semigroups, and subsemigroups of Rees 0-matrix
	    semigroups. It is now possible to compute anything about one of
	    these ideals that could formerly only be computed about a semigroup
	    defined by a generating set. Such ideals now use a data structure
	    similar to that used by semigroups defined by a generating set;
	    
	    • the new operations IsomorphismSemigroups, IsIsomorphicSemigroup,
	    and SmallestMultiplicationTable. Some of the methods for this
	    operation require the Grape package to be fully installed; 
	    
	    • the new operation MaximalSubsemigroups, which returns the maximal
	    subsemigroups of an arbitrary semigroup. Some of the methods for
	    this operation require the Grape package to be fully installed;

	    • the operation IsMaximalSubsemigroup;

	    • the new operation Normalizer for computing a subgroup of a
	    permutation group consisting of those permutations that stabilise,
	    under conjugation, a transformation, partial perm, or bipartition
	    semigroup. The genss package is required for this operation in some
	    cases;
	    
	    • the new operation CharacterTableOfInverseSemigroup for finding the
	    character table of an inverse semigroup of partial permutations;

	    • methods for defining and manipulating the congruences of a Rees
	    0-matrix semigroup;

	    • the properties IsCongruenceFreeSemigroup, IsEUnitaryInverseSemigroup;

	    • the attributes:
	      
	      ComponentRepsOfTransformationSemigroup
	      ComponentsOfTransformationSemigroup
	      CyclesOfTransformationSemigroup
	      ComponentRepsOfPartialPermSemigroup 
	      ComponentsOfPartialPermSemigroup
	      CyclesOfPartialPermSemigroup.
	    
	    • the new function IteratorFromGeneratorsFile that returns an
	    iterator which reads semigroup elements from a file created using
	    WriteGenerators. This function is a convenient way of, for example,
	    looping over a collection of generators in a file without loading
	    every object in the file into memory. This  might be useful if
	    the file contains more information than there is available memory;

	    • the operation EndomorphismsPartition that returns the monoid
	    of endomorphisms preserving a partition. This monoid is defined
	    using the minimum possible number of generators;

	    • a version of the function Splash that attempts to convert a string 
	    containing a dot or tikz document into a pdf and opens this pdf.
	    Other file formats are also supported;

	    • the function DotSemilatticeOfIdempotents that produces a string
	    containing a dot document of the semilattice of idempotents of an
	    inverse semigroup grouped by D-class;

	    • the operation NaturalLeqInverseSemigroup, which is an umbrella
	    operation for NaturalLeqPartialPerm, and other such functions. 

	    *************************Resolved issues************************* 
	    
	    Issue numbers refer to the issues on the tracker at:

	    http://bitbucket.org/james-d-mitchell/semigroups/issues
	    
	    • the main algorithm underlying many of the methods in Semigroups
	    has been revised to avoid computing the same information more than
	    once. Some further internal rearranging and cleaning up was done. 
	    
	    • MinimalIdeal and SingularTransformationSemigroup now returns an
	    ideal rather than a semigroup defined by a generating set;

	    • to reduce the size of the package archive, the examples directory
	    has been removed. The content of the examples directory is available
	    on the webpage: http://tinyurl.com/jdmitchell/data.php

	    • several bugs in the setup for subsemigroups of Rees 0-matrix
	    semigroups were resolved. These issues would have caused GAP to give
	    an error in certain circumstances.
	   
	    • Issue 33: an error was returned when trying to calculate the size,
	    or multiply elements in the quotient of a semigroup by an ideal.

	    • Issue 36, 64: the function SmallGeneratingSet was ambiguous, in
	    the sense that it was sometimes unclear how to recreate a semigroup
	    from its small generating set. For example, SmallGeneratingSet of a
	    monoid could return an empty list, but this empty list could not be
	    used to recreate the monoid in GAP. This was resolved by introducing
	    the functions SmallSemigroupGeneratingSet, SmallMonoidGeneratingSet,
	    SmallInverseSemigroupGeneratingSet, SmallInverseMonoidGeneratingSet.
	    These functions can also now be applied to collections of elements,
	    i.e. not only to semigroups. 
	    
	    • Issues 47: ClosureSemigroup had several bugs that could, in some
	    cases, result in incorrect results, or semigroups with invalid data
	    structures. 

	    • Issues 50, 59: WriteGenerators wrote nothing to a file in the case
	    that it was not piping through xz or gzip. 

	    • Issue 55: DotDClasses did not work when the argument was a Rees
	    0-matrix semigroup (it worked as intended when the argument was a
	    subsemigroup of such a semigroup defined by a generating set). 

	    • Issue 56: the functions Monoid and InverseMonoid sometimes
	    did not contain their identity element.

	    • Issue 57: under certain circumstances a bug in the GAP kernel
	    function INV_KER_TRANS, that didn't handle kernels and
	    transformations with different length and degree properly, caused
	    GAP to give an error.

	    • Issue 63: there was an error in the GAP library functions Monoid
	    and InverseMonoid, when they were passed a monoid as an argument. 

	    • Issue 63 (and Issue 4 in the Orb package): a bug in the Orb
	    package meant that the log of an Orb was not properly updated if the
	    enumeration stopped early because we found something we were looking
	    for. This caused Semigroups to return incorrect results in some rare
	    cases. 
	   
	    • Issue 72: the method for IsomorphismTransformationSemigroup
	    applied to a binary relation monoid returned an isomorphism to a
	    transformation semigroup which was missing the image of the
	    identity. 

	    • Issue 89: there was a bug in TRANS_IMG_CONJ which failed to handle
	    transformations of unequal degrees correctly. This causes incorrect
	    results to be returned when considering semigroups generated by
	    transformations of unequal degrees.

1.3 -> 1.4  
            This is a minor release containing some bug fixes. Specifically:
            the functionality of ReadGenerators and WriteGenerators has been
            improved to allow the argument to be an IO file object, and support
            is added to read and write directly to files compressed using
            xz. A minor bug relating to the creation of idempotents in
            transformation semigroups which was triggered by the identity
            transformation has been resolved. The functions
            IsomorphismReesMatrixSemigroup, InjectionPrincipalFactor, and
            IsZeroSimpleSemigroup have been revised. IsZeroSimpleSemigroup
            formerly returned true for the 2 element zero semigroup, which is
            not 0-simple. IsomorphismReesMatrixSemigroup could have returned an
            error if called for a semigroup which was not a semigroup of
            partial perms or transformations. The use of AsPermutation was
            changed to PermutationOfImage where appropriate following a change
            to the library methods for AsPermutation. The declarations of
            IsomorphismPermGroup and ClosureSemigroup were moved/changed to
            avoid warnings that their methods matched more than one
            declaration. These warnings were exposed by doing LoadAllPackages,
            but were not present when loading Semigroups by itself.

1.2 -> 1.3  
            Version 1.3 contains many bug fixes, extensions and improvements in
            the documentation, and several new methods and functions. Most
            notably are (in no particular order): 
            
            • the methods in Semigroups have been extended to apply to
            arbitrary subsemigroups of regular Rees 0-matrix semigroups over
            groups; 
            
            • a new method for MaximalSubsemigroups of Rees matrix
            semigroup has been implemented; 
            
            • the function Read/WriteSemigroups have been renamed
            Read/WriteGenerators and their performance has been improved. It is
            now possible to use WriteGenerators to write to a gzipped file; 

            • the operation SingularSemigroup has been renamed
            SingularTransformationSemigroup;

            • the following attributes have been introduced: MinimalDClass,
            MaximalDClasses, StructureDescriptionMaximalSubgroups,
            StructureDescriptionSchutzenbergerGroups, and IsGreensDLeq.
            
            • the attribute/operation DotDClasses has been introduced. This
            allows the D-class diagram of a semigroup to be viewed.

            • ComponentRepsOfTransformationSemigroup is reintroduced.

1.1 -> 1.2
            This release includes several new methods for inverse semigroups of
            partial permutations and for free inverse semigroups. Most notably
            among the new methods for inverse semigroups of partial
            permutations are:

                SmallerDegreePartialPermRepresentation 
            
            and 
                
                VagnerPrestonRepresentation

            for changing the representation of an inverse semigroup of partial 
            permutations. The changes in this release were the result of the 
            University of St Andrews Research for Undergraduates Summer School 
            in 2012, and were largely written by Wilf Wilson and Robert Hancock.

            Free inverse semigroups, and their elements, are also introduced,
            this part of the package was written by Julius Jonusas (who wishes
            to acknowledge the support of the Carnegie Trust).

1.0 -> 1.1  
            A minor release to fix some technical issues in PackageInfo.g, the
            declarations of IsGreens.Class, and a minor change in the output in
            one test in everyfunction.tst which was consequence of the
            declarations of IsGreens.Class.

0.9999 -> 1.0
            The package has been renamed from Citrus to Semigroups. The package
            has been completely overhauled, the performance has been improved,
            and the code has been generalized so that in the future the same
            code can be used to compute with other types of semigroups.  

Under the name Citrus:

0.999 -> 0.9999
            This is the final release of Citrus (the package will be renamed
            Citrus in the next release since the scope of the package has
            expanded to include more types of semigroups than just those of
            transformations and partial permutations).

            A minor release fixing several bugs relating to inverse semigroups
            of partial permutations pointed out by partcipants at the
            University of St Andrews Research for Undergraduates Summer School
            in July 2012.  Most notably by Demi Allen, Casey Donoven, Rhiannon
            Dougall, Robert Hancock, and Wilf Wilson. More specifically,
            SymmetricInverseSemigroup(n) returned an incorrect answer when n=1
            or n=2, \in for the empty mapping and an inverse semigroup of
            partial perms sometimes incorrectly returned false, some harmless
            compiler warnings were displayed when using more recent versions of
            gcc, NaturalLeqPP sometimes returned the incorrect value, there was
            no method for IsInverseSemigroup or IsInverseMonoid for a semigroup
            of partial perms.

0.99 -> 0.999 
            A minor release fixing several bugs relating to partial
            permutations and monoids thereof, pointed out by Jack Schmidt.
            More specifically, MultiplicativeZero sometimes incorrectly
            returned fail for a inverse semigroup of partial permutations,
            sometimes PartialPerm incorrectly returned fail when given a dense
            range as an argument, sometimes the size of an inverse monoid was 1
            more than the correct value, and RestrictedPP sometimes failed when
            it should not have. 

0.9 -> 0.99 
            another minor release. Specific changes were: removed the
            declaration of SmallGeneratingSet for IsSemigroup since it appears
            not to be used and caused a warning to be shown when rcwa was
            loaded after Citrus. Added a new abstract to the PackageInfo.g
            file, and the documentation, and updated the webpages, in
            particular so that the html version of the manual is linked to that
            on the GAP webpage and the links to other manuals work. 

0.8 -> 0.9 
            renamed the function for creating the semigroup of order-preserving
            transformations on an n-chain from O to OrderEndomorphisms after it
            was pointed out that it is not sensible to have function names with
            one character. Also made some minor adjustments to the manual.

0.7 -> 0.8 
            minor changes due to incompatibility with Smallsemi 0.6.4 which 
            caused some test files to fail when Nilmat was loaded after
            Citrus.  The clashes and the failed test were caused by various
            properties being declared for IsTransformationSemigroup rather than
            IsSemigroup. 

0.6 -> 0.7 
            the most major change is the introduction of special methods for
            partial permutations and inverse semigroups. So that these methods
            are efficient, a GAP kernel component (in C) has also been
            introduced for various low-level computations with partial
            permutations. Essentially all functions previously available for
            transformation semigroups are now available for inverse semigroups
            of partial permutations. The manual has been expanded and
            reorganised, some standard examples have been included (semigroups
            of order preserving transformations or partial permutations, the
            symmetric inverse semigroup, the full matrix semigroup over a
            finite field), the endomorphism monoids of the non-abelian groups
            with at most 64 elements have been included in the catalogues of
            examples, the functions InjectionPrincipalFactor,
            IsomorphismReesMatrixSemigroup, and PrincipalFactor, and some
            specific properties and attributes of inverse semigroups have been
            introduced (such as IsFactorisableSemigroup and
            PrimitiveIdempotents).

0.5 -> 0.6 
            fixed a bug relating to the creation of transformation semigroups 
            using MagmaByGenerators. Also added the global variable 
            CitrusOptionsRec containing the default values of the options
            used by Citrus when creating a semigroup. 

0.4 -> 0.5
            major changes are: the documentation has been further revised,
            functions for creating semigroups and monoids with certain
            options have been introduced, several functions have had the word
            `Greens' removed from their names to reduce the length, the
            operation ClosureSemigroup has been introduced, the functions
            ReadCitrus and WriteCitrus for reading and writing
            transformations to a file have been introduced, several catalogues
            of examples of transformation semigroups are now included in the
            examples directory, methods for creating a Green's class inside
            another Green's class have been included (such as an R-class of a
            D-class or an H-class of an L-class), the hash functions used for
            transformations etc have been improved. 
            
            Some minor bugs have been fixed, and new methods or functions with
            the following names have also been introduced:

            AntiIsomorphismTransformationSemigroup (for a trans. semigroup),
            IdempotentGeneratedSubsemigp, IsomorphismTransformationSemigroup
            (for a perm. gp), IsomorphismTransformationMonoid (for a perm. gp),
            NrElementsOfRank.

0.3 -> 0.4
            major changes are: the documentation has been updated, some changes
            to core functions for R-classes/image orbits have resulted in a 
            performance improvement, there is a method for the operation
            Factorization allowing an arbitrary element of a transformation
            semigroup to be expressed as a product of the generators. 
            
            Some minor bugs have been fixed, and new methods or functions with
            the following names have also been introduced:
            
            OrbSCC, OrbSCCLookup, OrbSCCTruthTable, 
            ReverseSchreierTreeOfSCC, SchreierTreeOfSCC,
            IsomorphismTransformationSemigroup (for a perm. gp). 

0.2 -> 0.3 
            fixed a critical (but rare) bug in AddToOrbitsOfKernels that caused
            computations relating to D-classes, H-classes, or L-classes to
            return incorrect answers in some cases. 

0.1 -> 0.2  
            updated the method for \^ for a transformation and perm so that it
            is more efficient than the library method, same for \* for a perm 
            and transformation. New method for StructureDescription of a
            Brandt semigroup, and IsSubset for a trans. semigroup and trans.
            coll. 
    
            fixed bugs in IndexPeriodOfTransformation (it returned incorrect
            results) and AsPermutation. Also reduce hash table lengths so that 
            Citrus uses less memory. Fixed bug that triggered an infinite
            loop when trying to find elements of a trivial trans. semigroup.  

            added the functions CitrusDefaultMem, CitrusHiMem,
            CitrusLoMem, CitrusVeryLoMem, IsBrandtSemigroup,
            IsLeftSimple, IsMonogenicSemigroup, IsRightSimple,
            IsZeroRectangularBand, IsZeroSimpleSemigroup.
