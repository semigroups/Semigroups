    <Description>
      This function should be called with no argument to run some long-running
      tests, which could be used to benchmark &Semigroups; or test your
      hardware. These tests should take no more than around half an hour to
      complete.  To quickly test that &Semigroups; is installed correctly use
      <Ref Func = "SemigroupsTestInstall"/>, or to test all aspects of the
      package use <Ref Func = "SemigroupsTestStandard"/>.<P/>

      satisfying <Ref Filt="IsActingSemigroup"/> are enabled and once when they
      are disabled.
