  <Abstract>
    The &Semigroups; package is a &GAP; package containing methods for
    semigroups, monoids, and inverse semigroups. The methods in &Semigroups;
    can be applied to any semigroup created in &GAP;. There are particularly
    efficient methods for semigroups or ideals consisting of transformations,
    partial permutations, bipartitions, partitioned binary relations
    subsemigroups of regular Rees 0-matrix semigroups, and matrices of various
    semirings including boolean or tropical matrices. 
    <P/>
    
    &Semigroups; contains efficient methods for creating semigroups, monoids,
    and inverse semigroup, calculating their Green's structure, ideals, size,
    elements, group of units, small generating sets, testing membership,
    finding the inverses of a regular element, factorizing elements over the
    generators, and more. It is possible to test if a semigroup satisfies a
    particular property, such as if it is regular, simple, inverse, completely
    regular, and a variety of further properties. 
    <P/>
    
    There are methods for finding presentations for a semigroup, congruences,
    the normalizer of a semigroup in a permutation group, the maximal
    subsemigroups of a finite semigroup, and smaller degree partial permutation
    representations and the character tables of inverse semigroups. There are
    functions for producing pictures of the Green's structure of a semigroup,
    and for drawing graphical representations of certain types of elements.
