    <Heading>For those in a hurry</Heading>
    In this section we give a brief description of how to start using
    &SEMIGROUPS;.<P/>

    It is assumed that you have a working copy of &GAP; with version number
    &GAPVERS; or higher. The most up-to-date version of &GAP; and instructions
    on how to install it can be obtained from the main &GAP; webpage
    <URL>https://www.gap-system.org</URL>.<P/>

    The following is a summary of the steps that should lead to a
    successful installation of &SEMIGROUPS;:

    <List>

      <Item>
        ensure that the &DATASTRUCTURES; package version &DATASTRUCTURESVERS;
        or higher is available.  &DATASTRUCTURES; must be compiled before
        &SEMIGROUPS; can be loaded.
      </Item>

      <Item>
        ensure that the &DIGRAPHS; package version &DIGRAPHSVERS; or higher is
        available.  &DIGRAPHS; must be compiled before &SEMIGROUPS; can be
        loaded.
      </Item>

      <Item>
        ensure that the &GENSS; package version &GENSSVERS; or higher is
        available.
      </Item>

      <Item>
        ensure that the &IMAGES; package version &IMAGESVERS; or higher is
        available.
      </Item>

      <Item>
        ensure that the &IO; package version &IOVERS; or higher is available.
        &IO; must be compiled before &SEMIGROUPS; can be loaded.
      </Item>

      <Item>
        ensure that the &ORB; package version &ORBVERS; or higher is available.
        &ORB; and &SEMIGROUPS; both perform better if &ORB; is compiled.
      </Item>

      <Item>
        download the package archive <F>&ARCHIVENAME;</F> from
        <URL Text = "the Semigroups package webpage">https://semigroups.github.io/Semigroups</URL>.
      </Item>

      <Item>
        unzip and untar the file, this should create a directory called
        <F>semigroups-&VERSION;</F>.
      </Item>

      <Item>
        locate your &GAP; directory, the one containing the directories
        <F>lib</F>, <F>doc</F> and so on. Move the directory
        <F>semigroups-&VERSION;</F> into the <F>pkg</F> subdirectory of your &GAP;
        directory.
      </Item>

      <Item>
        from version 3.0.0, it is necessary to compile the &SEMIGROUPS; package.
        &SEMIGROUPS; uses the
        <URL Text="libsemigroups">
          https://libsemigroups.github.io/libsemigroups/
        </URL>
        C++ library, which requires a compiler implementing the C++14 standard.
        Inside the <F>pkg/semigroups-&VERSION;</F> directory, in your terminal
        type
        <Listing><![CDATA[
./configure && make
        ]]></Listing>
        Further information about this step can be found in Section
        <Ref Sect = "Compiling the kernel module"/>.
      </Item>

      <Item>
        start &GAP; in the usual way (i.e. type <C>gap</C> at the command line).
      </Item>

      <Item>
        type <C>LoadPackage("semigroups");</C>
      </Item>
    </List>

    <E><B>Please note that</B> from version 3.0.0: &SEMIGROUPS; can only be
      loaded if it has been compiled.</E><P/>

    If you want to check that the package is working correctly, you
    should run some of the tests described in Section
    <Ref Sect = "Testing your installation"/>.

  <Section Label = "Compiling the kernel module">
    <Heading>Compiling the kernel module</Heading>
    As of version 3.0.0, the &SEMIGROUPS; package has a kernel module written
    in C++ and this must be compiled.  The kernel module contains the interface
    to the C++ library &LIBSEMIGROUPS;.  It is not possible to use the
    &SEMIGROUPS; package without compiling it.
    <P/>

    To compile the kernel component inside the <F>pkg/semigroups-&VERSION;</F>
    directory, type
    <Listing><![CDATA[
./configure && make
    ]]></Listing>
    <P/>

    If you are using GCC to compile &SEMIGROUPS;, then version 5.0 or higher is
    required. Trying to compile &SEMIGROUPS; with an earlier version of GCC
    will result in an error at compile time. &SEMIGROUPS; only supports GCC
    version 5.0 or higher, and clang version 5.0 or higher.<P/>

    If you installed the package in a <F>pkg</F> directory other than the
    standard <F>pkg</F> directory in your &GAP; installation, then you have to
    do two things. Firstly during compilation you have to use the option
    <C>--with-gaproot=PATH</C> of the <C>configure</C> script where <C>PATH</C>
    is a path to the main &GAP; root directory (if not given the default
    <C>../..</C> is assumed).<P/>

    If you installed &GAP; on several architectures, you must execute the
    configure/make step for each of the architectures. You can either do this
    immediately after configuring and compiling &GAP; itself on this
    architecture, or alternatively set the environment variable
    <C>CONFIGNAME</C> to the name of the configuration you used when compiling
    &GAP; before running <C>./configure</C>.  Note however that your compiler
    choice and flags (environment variables <C>CC</C> and <C>CFLAGS</C>) need
    to be chosen to match the setup of the original &GAP; compilation. For
    example you have to specify 32-bit or 64-bit mode correctly!

  <Section Label = "Rebuilding the documentation">
    <Heading>Rebuilding the documentation</Heading>

    The &SEMIGROUPS; package comes complete with pdf, html, and text versions
    of the documentation. However, you might find it necessary, at some point,
    to rebuild the documentation. To rebuild the documentation the &GAPDoc; and
    &AUTODOC; packages are required. To rebuild the documentation type:
    <Listing><![CDATA[
gap makedoc.g
    ]]></Listing>
    when you're inside the <F>pkg/semigroups-&VERSION;</F> directory.

    In this section we describe how to test that &SEMIGROUPS; is working as
    intended.  To quickly test that &SEMIGROUPS; is installed correctly use
    <Ref Func = "SemigroupsTestInstall"/>.  For more extensive tests use
    <Ref Func = "SemigroupsTestStandard"/>.  Finally, for lengthy benchmarking
    tests use <Ref Func = "SemigroupsTestExtreme"/>.
    <P/>

    If something goes wrong, then please review the instructions in Section
    <Ref Sect = "For those in a hurry"/> and ensure that &SEMIGROUPS; has been
    properly installed.  If you continue having problems, please use the
    <URL Text = "issue tracker">https://github.com/semigroups/Semigroups/issues</URL>
    to report the issues you are having.
