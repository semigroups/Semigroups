  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YIntroduction[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  is  the  manual  for  the [5XSemigroups[105X package version 2.8.0. [5XSemigroups[105X
  2.8.0   is   a   distant   descendant  of  the  Monoid  package  for  GAP  3
  ([7Xhttp://schmidt.nuigalway.ie/monoid/index.html[107X)  by Goetz Pfeiffer, Steve A.
  Linton,  Edmund F. Robertson, and Nik Ruskuc; and the Monoid package for GAP
  4 by J. D. Mitchell.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YMany of the operations, methods, properties, and functions described in this
  manual  only  apply  to semigroups of transformations, partial permutations,
  bipartitions, subsemigroups of regular Rees 0-matrix semigroups over groups,
  semigroups of matrices over finite fields, free inverse semigroups, and free
  bands.  For  the sake of brevity, we have opted to say [12Xsemigroup[112X to describe
  the aforementioned classes of semigroups.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XSemigroups[105X 2.8.0 contains more efficient methods than those available in the
  [5XGAP[105X  library  (and in many cases more efficient than any other software) for
  creating  semigroups  and ideals, calculating their Green's structure, size,
  elements, group of units, minimal ideal, and testing membership, finding the
  inverses of a regular element, and factorizing elements over the generators,
  and  many more; see Chapters [14X2[114X, [14X3[114X, and [14X4[114X. There are also methods for testing
  if  a  semigroup  satisfies a particular property, such as if it is regular,
  simple,  inverse,  completely  regular, and a variety of further properties;
  see  Chapter  [14X4[114X. The theory behind the main algorithms in [5XSemigroups[105X will be
  described in a forthcoming article.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIt  is  harder  for  [5XSemigroups[105X  to  compute  Green's  [13XL[113X- and [13XH[113X-classes of a
  transformation  semigroup.  The  methods used to compute with Green's [13XR[113X- and
  [13XD[113X-classes  are  the most efficient in [5XSemigroups[105X. Thus, if you are computing
  with  a  transformation semigroup, wherever possible, it is advisable to use
  the  commands relating to Green's [13XR[113X- or [13XD[113X-classes rather than those relating
  to  Green's [13XL[113X- or [13XH[113X-classes. No such difficulties are present when computing
  with  semigroups  of  partial permutations, bipartitions, subsemigroups of a
  regular Rees 0-matrix semigroup over a group, or semigroups of matrices over
  a finite field.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  methods  in  [5XSemigroups[105X  allow  the  computation  of individual Green's
  classes  without  computing  the  entire  data  structure  of the underlying
  semigroup;  see  [2XGreensRClassOfElementNC[102X  ([14X4.2-3[114X).  It  is  also possible to
  compute  the  [13XR[113X-classes,  the  number  of  elements and test membership in a
  semigroup   without   computing   all   the   elements;  see,  for  example,
  [2XGreensRClasses[102X  ([14X4.3-1[114X),  [2XRClassReps[102X  ([14X4.3-4[114X), [2XIteratorOfRClassReps[102X ([14X4.3-2[114X),
  [2XIteratorOfRClasses[102X ([14X4.3-3[114X), or [2XNrRClasses[102X ([14X4.4-6[114X). This may be useful if you
  want to study a very large semigroup where computing all the elements of the
  semigroup is not feasible.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThere  are  methods  for finding: congruences of certain types of semigroups
  (based  on  Section  3.5  in  [How95]),  the  normalizer of a semigroup in a
  permutation  group  (as  given  in [ABMN10]), the maximal subsemigroups of a
  finite  semigroup  (based  on  [GGR68]),  smaller degree partial permutation
  representations  (based  on  [Sch92])  and the character table of an inverse
  semigroup.  There  are  functions  for  producing  pictures  of  the Green's
  structure of a semigroup, and for drawing bipartitions; see Sections [14X4.8[114X and
  [14X5.8[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSeveral  standard  examples  of  semigroups  are  provided  see Section [14X2.5[114X.
  [5XSemigroups[105X  also  provides  functions  to  read  and  write  collections  of
  transformations,  partial  permutations,  and  bipartitions  to  a file; see
  [2XReadGenerators[102X ([14X1.6-2[114X) and [2XWriteGenerators[102X ([14X1.6-3[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YDetails  of  how  to create and manipulate semigroups of bipartitions can be
  found in Chapter [14X5[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YDetails of how to create and manipulate semigroups of matrices over a finite
  field can be found in Chapter [14X7[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThere are also functions in [5XSemigroups[105X to define and manipulate free inverse
  semigroups  and  their  elements;  this  part  of the package was written by
  Julius Jonušas; see Chapter [14X6[114X and Section 5.10 in [How95] for more details.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XSemigroups[105X contains functions synonymous to some of those defined in the [5XGAP[105X
  library  but,  for  the  sake  of  convenience, they have abbreviated names;
  further details can be found at the appropriate points in the later chapters
  of this manual.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XSemigroups[105X contains different methods for some [5XGAP[105X library functions, and so
  you might notice that [5XGAP[105X behaves differently when [5XSemigroups[105X is loaded. For
  more details about semigroups in [5XGAP[105X or Green's relations in particular, see
  [14X'Reference: Semigroups'[114X or [14X'Reference: Green's Relations'[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  [5XSemigroups[105X  package  is  written  [5XGAP[105X  code and requires the [5XOrb[105X and [5XIO[105X
  packages.  The  [5XOrb[105X  package  is  used  to efficiently compute components of
  actions,  which  underpin many of the features of [5XSemigroups[105X. The [5XIO[105X package
  is  used  to  read  and  write  transformations,  partial  permutations, and
  bipartitions to a file.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe     [5XGrape[105X     package    must    be    loaded    for    the    operation

  normal with the exception that the functions above will not work.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe [5Xgenss[105X package is used in one version of the function [2XNormalizer[102X ([14X4.5-23[114X)
  but  nowhere  else in [5XSemigroups[105X. If [5Xgenss[105X is not available, then [5XSemigroups[105X
  can be used as normal with the exception that this function will not work.[133X

  [33X[0;0YIn  this  section  we  give  a  brief  description  of  how  to  start using
  [5XSemigroups[105X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIt  is assumed that you have a working copy of [5XGAP[105X with version number 4.8.3
  or  higher.  The  most  up-to-date version of [5XGAP[105X and instructions on how to

  [7Xhttp://www.gap-system.org[107X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  following  is  a  summary of the steps that should lead to a successful
  installation of [5XSemigroups[105X:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yensure  that  the  [5XIO[105X package version 4.4.4 or higher is available. [5XIO[105X
        must be compiled before [5XSemigroups[105X can be loaded.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yensure  that the [5XOrb[105X package version 4.7.3 or higher is available. [5XOrb[105X

  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[12XThis  step  is  optional:[112X  certain functions in [5XSemigroups[105X require the
        [5XGrape[105X package to be available and fully compiled; a full list of these
        functions  can  be  found above. To use these functions make sure that
        the  [5XGrape[105X package version 4.5 or higher is available. If [5XGrape[105X is not
        fully installed (i.e. compiled), then [5XSemigroups[105X can be used as normal
        with the exception that the functions listed above will not work.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[12XThis  step  is optional:[112X the non-deterministic version of the function
        [2XNormalizer[102X  ([14X4.5-23[114X)  requires  the [5Xgenss[105X package to be loaded. If you
        want  to  use this function, then please ensure that the [5Xgenss[105X package

  [33X[0;0YThis  function  provides  a  method  for  writing  transformations,  partial
  permutations,  and  bipartitions  to  a  file,  that uses a relatively small
  amount  of  disk  space.  The resulting file can be further compressed using
  [10Xgzip[110X or [10Xxz[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  argument  [3Xlist[103X  should be a list of elements, a semigroup, or a list of
  lists  of  elements,  or  semigroups.  The  types of elements and semigroups
  supported are: transformations, partial permutations, and bipartitions.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe argument [3Xfilename[103X should be a string containing the name of a file where
  the entries in [3Xlist[103X will be written or an [5XIO[105X package file object.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  the  optional  third  argument  [3Xappend[103X is given and equals [10X"w"[110X, then the
  previous  content  of the file is deleted. If the optional third argument is
  [10X"a"[110X  or  is  not  present,  then [10Xlist[110X is appended to the file. This function
  returns [9Xtrue[109X if everything went well or [9Xfail[109X if something went wrong.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[10XWriteGenerators[110X appends a line to the file [3Xfilename[103X for every entry in [3Xlist[103X.
  If any element of [3Xlist[103X is a semigroup, then the generators of that semigroup
  are written to [3Xfilename[103X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  first character of the appended line indicates which type of element is
  contained  in  that line, the second character [10Xm[110X is the number of characters
  in  the  degree of the elements to be written, the next [10Xm[110X characters are the
  degree  [10Xn[110X  of the elements to be written, and the internal representation of
  the elements themselves are written in blocks of [10Xm*n[110X in the remainder of the
  line. For example, the transformations:[133X

  [6XReturns:[106X  [33X[0;10YAn iterator.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  [3Xfilename[103X  is  a  string  containing  the  name  of  a file created using
  [2XWriteGenerators[102X ([14X1.6-3[114X), then [10XIteratorFromGeneratorsFile[110X returns an iterator
  [10Xiter[110X  such that [10XNextIterator(iter)[110X returns the next collection of generators
  stored in the file [3Xfilename[103X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis function is a convenient way of, for example, looping over a collection
  of  generators  in  a  file  without  loading  every object in the file into
  memory.  This  might  be  useful  if the file contains more information than
  there is available memory.[133X
