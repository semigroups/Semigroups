    <Returns>A minimal set ideal generators of an ideal.</Returns>
    <Description>
      This function returns a minimal set of elements of the parent of the
      semigroup ideal <A>I</A> required to generate <A>I</A> as an ideal. <P/>

      The notion of the generators of an ideal is distinct from the notion of
      the generators of a semigroup or monoid.  In particular, the semigroup
      generated by the generators of an ideal is not, in general, equal to that
      ideal. Use <Ref Attr = "GeneratorsOfSemigroup" BookName = "ref"/> to obtain a
      semigroup generating set for an ideal, but beware that this can be very
      costly.

      <Example><![CDATA[
gap> S := Monoid([
> Bipartition([[1, 2, 3, -2], [4], [-1, -4], [-3]]),
> Bipartition([[1, 4, -2, -4], [2, -1, -3], [3]])]);;

    <Returns>The generators of an ideal of a semigroup.</Returns>
    <Description>
      This function returns the generators of the two-sided ideal <A>I</A>,
      which were used to defined <A>I</A> when it was created. <P/>

      If <A>I</A> is an ideal of a semigroup, then <A>I</A> is defined to be the
      least 2-sided ideal of a semigroup <C>S</C> containing a set <C>J</C> of
      elements of <C>S</C>. The set <C>J</C> is said to <E>generate</E> <A>I</A>.
      <P/>

      The notion of the generators of an ideal is distinct from the notion of
      the generators of a semigroup or monoid.  In particular, the semigroup
      generated by the generators of an ideal is not, in general, equal to that

      An ideal of a semigroup.

      If <A>obj1</A>, <A>obj2</A>, .. . are (any combination) of elements of the

<#GAPDoc Label="SupersemigroupOfIdeal">
  <ManSection>
    <Attr Name = "SupersemigroupOfIdeal" Arg = "I"/>
    <Returns>
      An ideal of a semigroup.
    </Returns>
    <Description>
      The <Ref Func = "Parent" BookName = "ref"/> of an ideal is the semigroup in
      which the ideal was created, i.e.  the first argument of <Ref
        Func = "SemigroupIdeal"/> or <C>SemigroupIdealByGenerators</C>. This
      function returns the semigroup containing the generators of the semigroup
      (i.e. <Ref Attr = "GeneratorsOfSemigroup" BookName = "ref"/>) which are
      used to compute the ideal.
      <P/>

      For a regular semigroup ideal, <C>SupersemigroupOfIdeal</C> will always be
      the top most semigroup used to create any of the predecessors of the
      current ideal. For example, if <C>S</C> is a semigroup, <C>I</C> is a
      regular ideal of <C>S</C>, and <C>J</C> is an ideal of <C>I</C>, then
      <C>Parent(J)</C> is <C>I</C> and <C>SupersemigroupOfIdeal(J)</C> is
      <C>S</C>.  This is to avoid computing a generating set for <C>I</C>,
      in this example, which is expensive and unnecessary since <C>I</C> is
      regular (in which case the Green's relations of <C>I</C> are just
      restrictions of the Green's relations on <C>S</C>).
      <P/>

      If <C>S</C> is a semigroup, <C>I</C> is a non-regular ideal of <C>S</C>,
      <C>J</C> is an ideal of <C>I</C>, then <C>SupersemigroupOfIdeal(J)</C> is
      <C>I</C>, since we currently have to use <C>GeneratorsOfSemigroup(I)</C>
      to compute anything about <C>I</C> other than its size and membership.

gap> S := FullTransformationSemigroup(8);
<full transformation monoid of degree 8>
gap> x := Transformation([2, 6, 7, 2, 6, 1, 1, 5]);;
gap> D := DClass(S, x);

    <Returns>
      An list of ideals.

    <Description>
      If <A>S</A> is a finite non-empty semigroup, then this attribute returns a
      list of the non-empty two-sided ideals of <A>S</A>. <P/>

      The ideals are returned in no particular order, and each ideal uses the
      minimum possible number of generators
      (see <Ref Attr = "GeneratorsOfSemigroupIdeal"/>).
